# IUPAC_nucleotide_codes
A simple HTML page with Javascript to determine all possible sequences represented by IUPAC nucleotide codes. To use, download a zipped version of the repository, extract the contents and run main.html using a web browser.

You will then be able to enter a sequence using IUPAC nucleotide codes, and all possible sequences using just the bases A,C,G and T will be displayed according the the table below:

| IUPAC nucleotide code | Base |
| --- | --- |
| A | Adenine |
| C | Cytosine |
| G | Guanine | 
| T (or U) | Thymine (or Uracil) |
| R | A or G | 
| Y | C or T |
| S | G or C |
| W | A or T |
| K | G or T | 
| M | A or C | 
| B | C or G or T | 
| D | A or G or T |
| H | A or C or T |
| V | A or C or G | 
| N | any base |
| . or - | gap |
