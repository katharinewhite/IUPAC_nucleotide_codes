# IUPAC_nucleotide_codes
A simple HTML page with Javascript to determine all possible sequences represented by IUPAC nucleotide codes. To use, download a zipped version of the repository, extract the contents and run main.html using a web browser.

You will then be able to enter a sequence using nucleotide codes A,C,G,T,R,Y,S,W,K or M (codes B,D,H,V and N still to be catered for), click "Calculate!" and all possible sequences using just A,C,G and T will be displayed.
